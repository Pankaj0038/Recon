> Tools/platforms that I used to bring out companies acquired by Meta
- [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/home)<br>
&emsp;Crunchbase is a comprehensive platform and database, thus I am using this to get the acquisitions of an organisation.

    - Steps to produce:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./passive/img/search.png" width="1000" height="250" /></td>
    <td>
      <p>First go to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/home">Crunchbase</a> and at the top of the website there is a search bar where you can enter the target and hit enter to execute the search query.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>If the intended target organisation is found then click on it and look for highlight</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="./passive/img/highmeta.png" width="1000" height="200" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>
